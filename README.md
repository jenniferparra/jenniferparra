ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jennifer Parra

I'm a front-end junior developer and also a psychology student. You might wonder what do they have in common, I think the sky is the limit. 

I like playing basketball and exercising, reading and doing puzzles. I love listening to music, most of my day goes by with an accompanying song.
